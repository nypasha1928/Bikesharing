# bikesharing

## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to do an analysis of NYC Citibike traffic to determine what a future business owner needs to prepare for, due to her future investment in a rental bike company in Des Moines. This Dataset was from August which is what our potential new business picked.


## Results

1. How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?

 . We can see that Male are the predominant bike riders in NYC with the highest popularity of rentals in the early mornings, most likely    due to traffic going towards work. As the day goes on we see all groups decrease as they are most likely using public or private transit.
