# bikesharing

## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to do an analysis of NYC Citibike traffic to determine what a future business owner needs to prepare for, due to her future investment in a rental bike company in Des Moines. This Dataset was from August which is what our potential new business picked.


## Results

1. How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?

 . We can see that Male are the predominant bike riders in NYC with the highest popularity of rentals in the early mornings, most likely    due to traffic going towards work. As the day goes on we see all groups decrease as they are most likely using public or private transit.

2. How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?

 . 
 
 3. A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

 4. Starting Locations Based on Usage

 . This map shows us that the stations that are used the most are near the water and in the middle of the city as expected.
 
 5. Ending Locations Based on Usage

 . Just as the starting locations graph this has the same graphic where we see that the top ending locations are aligned with the top starting locations, near the water and in the middle of the city.
 
 6. Gender Breakdown

. As stated before the gender demographic is predominatly Male Subscribers compared to the rest with a huge 1,372,601 count. While females subscribers only make up 493,752.

7. Repair Time

.This is a unqiue graph but it provides powerful insight as to which bikes need repairs based on usage. As a future business owner this input can be relevant when it comes to the end of the month and repairs need to be had.


## Summary

The results I provided shows what the analysis of CitiBike Rentals in NYC which shows that weekends tend to be less populated compared to the weekdays for Male Subscribers. Using a subscriber based platform may be more beneficial compared to a customer platform. The data also show that Thursdays are the most popular in terms of bike usage. But with all this information we still have to take note that Des Moines is a completely different city than NYC. This analysis should only be a primary step to begin the process of convincing the investor of an investment in a rental bike business in Des Moines.

For future analysis, I would go more into the actual costs of starting this business, such as repair costs, and initial investments. On the flip side I would see what the revenues are for NYC and see if barely profitting in NYC is worth all the trouble for Des Moines.
